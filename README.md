# Platypus.js
The Platypus.js is a platform for rapid development of enterprise-level JavaScript applications.

Platypus.js is a server side JavaScript platform designed on top of JavaEE 7+ technologies and Nashorn JavaScript engine.

Platypus.js comprises both asynchronous IO model and reasonable use of multithreading with only few intensivly used threads.

Platypus.js provides a developer with libraries needed to develop complete and ready for market applications.

In general, two programming languages are used while developing Platypus.js applications:
* JavaScript (ECMA-262-3 standard) for application logic implementation both on server side and client side.
* Sql for accessing relational databases.

Applications creation, editing, deployment, debugging and maintenance all may be performed using the Platypus.js IDE.

The Platypus.js IDE includes following development tools:

* Database structure visual editor.
* Sql queries visual editor.
* JavaScript code editor.
* ORM configuration visual editor.
* User interface forms visual editor.

## Features
The platform offers a set of features, making development process extremely productive:
* AMD JavaScript modules loader on server side, in browser and in Java SE Platypus.js client.
* Server side JavaScript modules within IoC paradigm with LPC (Local procedure calls) asynchronous interactions.
* Parallel execution scheme of JavaScript code using standard Java thread pools.
* JavaScript modules automatic global dependencies resolving as well as AMD dependencies resolving.
* Sql queries with named parameters and Sql clauses re-use.
* ORM (Object-Relation Mapping) for JavaScript with automatic inter-entities references resolving. 
* Cross-platform Java SE as well as HTML5 browser UI, sharing the same code and the layout.
* The UI widgets which directly interact with the data model, allowing implementation of a CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) user interface with visual configuration and without or just a little coding.
* Built-in security support, including users authentication and authorization, constraints of access to application resources.
* Application database schema structure and applicaton data migrations tools.
